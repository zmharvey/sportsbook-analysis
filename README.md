# Sportsbook Analysis - Arbitrage and +EV Scanner
- Scans sportsbooks and checks for +EV plays (instances where some books lag behind sharper books, essentially giving good value to place the bet).
- Utilized Claude Code to rapidly prototype data collection, value calculations, and dashboard setup. This allowed me to focus my efforts on data analysis regarding the ways sportsbooks set/update odds.
- Flask dashboard allows the user to understand what the program is doing and how it can be improved.
